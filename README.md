# Quelea-On-The-Web

## Purpose
Quelea On The Web is a NodeJS application built to access the mobile lyrics and remote control APIs built into Quelea. This will allow us to create custom displays that can be used for things like lower thirds display of lyrics in streaming software like OBS and Vmix and for stage displays for musicians and performers on stage. Built with HTML, Javascript and JQuery, compatibility should be wide across all modern browsers.
